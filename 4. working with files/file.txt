Fashion has always had a huge influence on people around the world. The main reason why we try to follow the latest fashion trends is a desire to look stylish, attractive, popular and more confident. Generally People judge a new person by his appearance and his clothes and only then, by his inner qualities. There is a proverb: "Good clothes open all doors." That's why we do our best to make a favourable impression on others. We spend a lot of money to keep up with fashion and buy designer clothes.

Fashion often means style, glamour and success. It is also a big business. It's hard to resist the temptation to buy some brand-name clothing in our modern world. Every day we pass by colourful shop-windows, we see plenty of ads everywhere: on buses, billboards, TV and in magazines. Many teenagers pay too much attention to their friends' and classmates' appearance. Sadly, if some parents are not able to afford buying trendy clothes with fashion labels, their kids often become outsiders. So clothes usually separate people into social groups.

In my opinion every person can have his own style and look unique. He should choose clothes according to his taste, age, job, constitution and character. I am glad to say that I don't pay so much attention to fashion and I am not its victim. I don't care too much about what other people wear. The most important thing for me in the outlook is neatness, natural look and beauty. And it should certainly suit the occasion. I must admit that some fashionable clothes are quite ridiculous and unpractical. There was a time, for instance, when young people wore baggy clothes, shoes on enormous platforms, red hair, black fingernails and bright make-up. To my mind, it was just a silly waste of money. Besides, if a person doesn't have a good taste he is not able to put things together and look attractive and stylish even in fashionable clothes.
